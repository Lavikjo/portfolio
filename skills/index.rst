I have accumulated skills through various projects in school and industry. Projects related to skills are linked.

Electronics
----------------

I like to design and create electrical devices. I am mostly interested in embedded systems and PCB design. I have created circuit boards for various projects. My experience with electronics range from designing radio transmitters to connecting my coffee pot to internet. (:doc:`plastics-product-design`, :doc:`electronics-workshop`)

Prototyping
-----------------

I have worked in projects creating proof-of-concept, functional and mockup prototypes. In industry I have assembled prototypes for Vaisala OPT 100 DGA (Dissolved Gas Analyzer).
