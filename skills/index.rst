I have accumulated skills through various projects in school and industry. Projects related to skills are linked. 

----------------
Electronics
----------------

I like to design and build electrical devices. I am mostly interested in embedded systems and PCB design. I have learned to document circuits in digital form. These means I have experience creating printed circuit board and schematic designs in ECAD software. I am also able to transfer these designs to the physical realm. I am familiar with generating proper files for professional PCB manufacturing. My experience with electronics range from designing radio transmitters to connecting my coffee pot to the Internet.

-----------------
Prototyping
-----------------

I have worked in projects creating proof-of-concept, functional and mockup prototypes. In industry I have assembled prototypes for Vaisala OPT 100 DGA (Dissolved Gas Analyzer). DGA prototypes were utilized for measurement performance and type testing of the product. These have taught me the fundamental way of thinking about reaching the minimum viable product.

----------------
3D-printing
----------------

I am familiar with additive manufacturing techniques and have built my own 3D-printer. I know the limits and strengths of additive manufacturing. I have used 3D-printer for creating enclosures and functional parts for prototypes. (:doc:`add-basics`, :doc:`electronics-workshop`)

--------
Teamwork
--------

Aaltonaut courses are mostly done in teams which has taught me valuable skill of working with different people. In the courses I have learned to brainstorm and present ideas. I also have learned different pitching techniques. From the industry I have learned working with Lean and scrum principles. This means that I am familiar with using tools like Kanban-boards and sprints in product development process. I have also used scrum-ban methods in agile software development while creating new guild website. (:doc:`add-basics`, `OPT100 DGA <http://www.vaisala.com/en/products/DGA-Monitor/Pages/OPT100.aspx>`_)
