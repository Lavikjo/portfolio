<p>In the course Plastics Product Design we were given the task to prototype a platform for the <em>Catchbox</em>.
We were given complete freedom to implement any features that we felt were important for the user.
Due to wireless nature of the product, it had normal AA batteries to power the microphone.
We wanted to replace these with rechargeable batteries and include wireless charging into the platform.</p>

<p>Our team consisted of two electrical, mechanical and chemical engineers.
I was responsible for implementing the charging system modification inside the <em>Catchbox</em> and on the platform.</p>
<p>Requirement for the charging controller inside the <em>Catchbox</em> was to be as small as possible.
Looking at all the existing solutions, they didn't fulfill this requirement.
I wanted to try my hand at implementing a small form factor printed circuit board for charging Li-ion batteries.
For achieving small size, I had to use tiny surface mount components.
I used a known design for the circuit and designed a PCB around it.
Little did I know about the requirements for the design when manufacturing the board yourself...</p>
<p>I made around five different revisions of the board and etched them myself.
Manufacturing at home requires looser tolerances which I did not take into account.</p>
