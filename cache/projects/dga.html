<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I have worked in Vaisala developing a new product for transformer monitoring. The product OPT100 DGA is a dissolved gas analyzer which measures the consentration of gases in transformer insulation oil.
My work consisted of assembling the prototypes from the scratch. The process involved a lot of mechanical assembly and wiring. I worked together with the product development team implementing rapid changes to the design of the prototype and testing new features.</p>
