Hello there! I am Joel Lavikainen, a 22 year-old student of Electrical Engineering at Aalto University.

I am currently a 3rd year student and almost finished with my bachelors. For my minor I studied interdisciplinary product development in `Aaltonaut <http://aaltonaut.fi/>`_ minor programme.

I have listed various projects from my minor and major here. They can be found under Projects page.
