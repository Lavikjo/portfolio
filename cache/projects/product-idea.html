<h1>Analysis of the product</h1>
<p>We identified the typical customer for our product. Additionally we did value and market analysis of the identified customer segment. The power drill was completely dismantled to recognize all the parts it was built from. We identified the materials used and tried to find out the manufacturer of certain part. We also tried to rationalize all the design choices made by the original developer. This means that we analyzed why certain material was used to achieve desired function.</p>
