Overview
--------

I have worked in Vaisala developing a new product for transformer monitoring. The product OPT100 DGA is a dissolved gas analyzer which measures the consentration of gases in transformer insulation oil.
My work consisted of assembling the prototypes from the scratch. The process involved a lot of mechanical assembly and wiring. I worked together with the product development team implementing rapid changes to the design of the prototype and testing new features.

Summary
-------

During my internship at Vaisala I have learned a lot how industrial product development works. I also learned professional communication with interdisplinary team and how to present my ideas to others. I found a new perspective on mechanical and electrical prototyping.


**Things I learned:**

* Product development process
* Prototyping
* Professional communication and teamwork
